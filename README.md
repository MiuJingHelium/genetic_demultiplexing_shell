# genetic_demultiplexing_shell
Repo of shell scripts for genetic demultiplexing of pooled scRNA-seq data. I live in the Stone Age, and that's why I use shell/bash. Credit to snakemake pipeline written by Marina Terekhova (github repo: https://github.com/teresho4/scRNA-seq_atlas_Hs_PBMC_aging/tree/main).
The original R and Python scripts have been moditifed to make sure the same pipeline can be ran over a slightly different set-up of files as well as samples.


Maybe I'll clean up the scripts and optimize them later on.
